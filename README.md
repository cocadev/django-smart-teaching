# Ayudar
In a typical class, it is usually observed that some active students are
able to get teacher’s attention while those who are not able to express
themselves well are not able to come under their teacher’s eyes.
This projects tries to bridge this gap between students and teachers
by listing out such students on the basis of marks. However, nothing
compares when it comes to teacher’s discretion hence this project also
allow the teacher to manually label different students appropriately.
This project, hence, helps to make a classroom more interactive, since
the teacher now knows about the needy students in her/his class. From
students’ point of view, it helps to get them the much needed guidance
from the teacher.This will be very beneficial for them ,since this will
help them work on their weakness in a better way
